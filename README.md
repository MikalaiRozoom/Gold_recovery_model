# Prediction of gold recovery ratio from gold ore
###The project file is quite large and needs time to load.
It was necessary to prepare a prototype machine learning model for "Polymetal". The model was supposed to predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. I had data with extraction and cleaning parameters at my disposal. The model will help in the future to optimize production in order not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.
